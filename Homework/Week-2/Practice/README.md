Try to follow the video from above and bring to the lecture next week your very first website. By this, we mean create your first HTML document with at least 
a title, 
a paragraph, 
an image, and
 an anchor link.

Submit your exercise by Sunday 18:00 to your assigned teacher via Slack. You can find which teacher is assigned in the Google drive.
